##### What is Replication In MongoDB

- Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple servers. Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability. With multiple copies of data on different servers, replication protects a database from the loss of a single server. Replication also allows you to recover from hardware failure and service interruptions.

##### What is Aggregation in MongoDB

- Aggregations operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the aggregation pipeline, the map-reduce function and single purpose aggregation methods and commands.
