##### What is Replication In MongoDB

- Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple servers. Replication provides redundancy and increases data availability. With multiple copies of data on different servers, replication protects a database from the loss of a single server. Replication also allows you to recover from hardware failure and service interruptions.
