```javascript
const a = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Bar",
  education: {
    name: "Engineering",
  },
};

const b = { ...a };

// What will be the output for each of the three "console.log" statements?

console.log(1, b);

a.lastName = "Smith";

console.log(2, b);

a.education.name = "psychology";

console.log(3, b);
```

In JavaScript, when you use the spread operator (`...`) to create a shallow copy of an object, it only copies the top-level properties of the object. If the properties are objects themselves, they are not deeply cloned; instead, their references are copied. This means that changes made to nested objects will affect both the original and the copied object. However, changes made to primitive values (like strings, numbers, etc.) will not affect the copied object because they are immutable.

Here's the breakdown of the output for each `console.log` statement:

1. `console.log(1, b);`

   - This will print the copied object `b` after it was created using the spread operator. Since it's a shallow copy, it will have the same properties as object `a`, including `firstName`, `lastName`, and `education`. The `education` object is a reference to the same object in memory as in `a`.

2. `a.lastName = "Smith";`

   - Here, we're changing the value of `lastName` in the original object `a` to "Smith". Since `b` is a shallow copy, it doesn't share the same reference to `lastName` as `a`. Therefore, changing `a.lastName` does not affect `b`.

3. `a.education.name = "psychology";`
   - In this line, we're changing the value of `name` inside the `education` object in the original object `a`. Since `b` is a shallow copy, it does share the same reference to the `education` object as `a`. Therefore, changing `a.education.name` to "psychology" will also affect `b.education.name`, and both will reflect the updated value.

So, the output will be:

```javascript
1 { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Bar', education: { name: 'Engineering' } }
2 { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Bar', education: { name: 'Engineering' } }
3 { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Smith', education: { name: 'psychology' } }
```
