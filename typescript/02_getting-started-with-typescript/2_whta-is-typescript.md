1. What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is a programming language to address shortcomings of JavaScript

2. Why do we need it?

#### Benefits

- Static typing
  - Statically-typed (c++, c#, Java)
    -
    ```c++
    int number = 10;
    number = "a"; [x]
    ```
  - ## Dynamically-typed (JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
    ```js
    let number = 10;
    number = "a";
    Math.round(number);
    ```
- Code completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notations

3. How is it different from JavaScript?
