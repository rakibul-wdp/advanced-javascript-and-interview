## Interpreted vs Compiled vs JIT

- Interpretation
- Interpreter goes line by line in source code and executes it on the go.
- Compilation
- When compiling, entire code is converted to machine code, after that it generates a executable file that can be run by machine.
- Just in time Compiled
- Use a mixture of interpretation and compilation.
