# Advanced Github and Advanced JavaScript

- High Abstraction
- Does not need any resource management and memory allocation.
- Garbage Collected
- It means that we don't need to worry about garbage cleanup. An algorithm inside JavaScript take care of garbage collection and cleaning.
- JIT compiled
- JavaScript is not purely interpreted language, rather modern JavaScript in just in time compiled.
- Multi-paradigm
- Paradigm: Mindset of code structure which will determine your coding style.
- Procedural Programming
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional Programming (FP)
- Prototyped-based
- Array (.prototype)-> methods (.pop .push . indexOf)
- Functions are first class citizen
- It means that you can throw function anywhere you want. You can treat function as a variable. You can pass function as a parameter of a function. You can return function from inside of another function. This feature gives you a lot of flexibility while using functions.
- Dynamically Typed
- You don't need to specify the type of the variable on the declaration.
- Single Threaded
- Single threaded means the execution of instructions happens in a single sequence.
